## Single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM)

A toolkit for simulations and analysis related to DNA SMLM in Python. The package will include: 

1. Basic particle detection and tracking functions for static and dynamic single molecule data
2. Point spread function models in 3D, sCMOS noise models, and information theoretic localization techniques
3. Functions for performing Monte Carlo simulations of photoswitching dynamics of fluorophores
4. Mathematical models for optimal experimental design
-------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Coarse-grained polymer models for simulating nucleosome dynamics
6. Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods for inferring polymer structure from image data
